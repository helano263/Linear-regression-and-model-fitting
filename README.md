# Project title

Linear regression and model fitting

## Overview

On this project 2 experiments are used:

- Battery characteristic equation and power curve

- Solar cell characteristic equation and power curve

Measurements are performed on the lab. Then, the constants of theoretical equations are estimated.

Check the figures to see the graphs and estimated values.

P.S.: The contents in the figures are written in portuguese

## More details

This is originally an experiment for Experimental Physics distipline at University of Sao Paulo

**For the battery experiment:**

We measure the tension and current across the battery. We are able to estimate the the characteristic constants related to the battery such as the e.m.f and the internal resistance. With the same measurements, we can plot the power characteristic curve

**For the solar cell experiment:**

We measure the tension and current across the solar cell. Given the theoretical model, we can estimate the constants related to that specific solar cell. 

All information needed to understand the experiment are contained on the figures, including the equation for the models as well as the estimated constants and their uncertainty.

## How to see the output from the code

Two figures are created, one for each experiment. Glance at the figures to see the measurements, how the model fits the measurements. Below the figure there are absolute residual graphs to have a better understanding about the measurements and fitted model deviations. Also on the figures, you can see the model equations for the experiment, the estimated constants along with their respective uncertainties, and the chi squared and number of degrees of freedom (GL).
